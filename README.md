## Project Overview
Sentiment analysis is a popular natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This project uses the IMDb movie reviews dataset to train and test models that predict whether a review is positive or negative.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering for text data
- Model training and evaluation
- Testing on unseen data
- Modular Python scripts for easy understanding and extension

## Dataset
The dataset used is the IMDb Large Movie Review Dataset (aclImdb), which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The dataset folder aclImdb should be placed in the root directory of the project.

## Installation
Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Adi1exe/Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-reviews.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-for-Movie-reviews
```
## Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies
```

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If requirements.txt is not present, you can install the main dependencies manually:
```

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
You may also need to download NLTK data:

python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
```
## Usage

Step 1: Load and preprocess the dataset
The dataset loading and preprocessing is handled in the scripts (run these files):
```
load_dataset.py - loads the dataset
```
```
preprocess.py - cleans and preprocesses the text data
```
```
feature_engineering.py - performs feature extraction
```

Step 2: Train the model
Run the training script:

```
python train.py
```
This will train the sentiment analysis model on the training data.

Step 3: Test the model
After training, you can test the model using:

```
python test_model.py
```
## This script evaluates the model on the test dataset and prints performance metrics.
